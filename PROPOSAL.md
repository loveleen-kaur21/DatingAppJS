# Project Proposal
## GitCommitted

### Description and Motivation:
In this project, we are making a dating web application for software developers. When signing up for the site you will have to answer a series of questions to make sure it is a developers only environment. When creating an account you will be asked about personal information and coding experience. The site will preform similarly to Tinder and have the swiping features and whenever you are matched you are given contact information. We want to include command line features as a theme. We saw this idea on a website for tinder and we were motivated to create something similar for our community. 

### Prior Art:
We took the most inspiration from Tinder because that was the most popular one. Our project will preform like Tinder with the swiping features.

### Core User Workflows:
- The user can create an account after passing the entry quiz
- The user can personalize their own bio and image to use
- The user can swipe through available profiles
- After getting matched the user can see contact information about the person they matched with
